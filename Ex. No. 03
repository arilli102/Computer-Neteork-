Aim:
	To implement and demonstrate communicate between udp client and a udp server using python scoket

Algorithm:

1. Import the socket module.
2. Create a socket object using socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM) for both client and server.
3.For the server:
  --> Bind the socket to a specific IP address and port using bind().
  --> Wait to receive data using recvfrom().
  --> Display the received message.
  --> Send a reply back to the client using sendto().
4. For the client:
  --> Send a message to the server using sendto().
  --> Wait for a response from the server using recvfrom().
  -->Display the serverâ€™s reply.
5. Close both sockets after communication is done.

*********************************************************************************

UDP Server (udp_server.py)
import socket

# Create UDP socket
server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)

# Bind to IP and port
server.bind(('localhost', 9999))
print("UDP Server is ready and waiting for messages...")

# Receive message from client
data, addr = server.recvfrom(1024)
print("Received from client:", data.decode())

# Send reply
server.sendto(b"Hello Client! Message received successfully.", addr)

# Close socket
server.close()

*********************************************************************************

UDP Client (udp_client.py)

import socket

# Create UDP socket
client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)

# Server address
server_address = ('localhost', 9999)

# Send message to server
client.sendto(b"Hello Server! This is UDP Client.", server_address)

# Receive reply from server
data, addr = client.recvfrom(1024)
print("Server says:", data.decode())

# Close socket
client.close()

**************************************************************************************

Sample Output:

Server Side Output:
UDP Server is ready and waiting for messages...
Received from client: Hello Server! This is UDP Client.

Client Side Output:
Server says: Hello Client! Message received successfully.



Result:
		Thus, the communication between the UDP client and UDP server was successfully implemented and demonstrated using Python socket programming.
