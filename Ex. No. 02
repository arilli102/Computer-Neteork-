Aim:
   To study the concepts of socket programming in python using tcp.

Algoritham:
  1. Python core networking library is scoket module.
  2. Python scoket module has both class-base and instances-based methods.
  3. Class based method is an intutive approach which doesn't need an instance of a socket project.
  4. In instance based method, if some data need to send server application
  5. Intvitive to create a scoket object to perform that explicit operation.
  6. This module has everything you need to build socket server and clients.

Program:

Server.py

import socket

# create socket and bind
server = socket.socket()
server.bind(('localhost', 9999))
server.listen(1)
print("Server waiting for connection...")

# accept client connection
conn, addr = server.accept()
print("Connected with", addr)

# receive message from client
data = conn.recv(1024).decode()
print("Client says:", data)

# send reply to client
conn.send(b"Hello Client, message received!")

# close connection
conn.close()

===========================================================================

client.py

import socket

# create socket and connect to server
client = socket.socket()
client.connect(('localhost', 9999))

# send message to server
client.send(b"Hello Server!")

# receive reply
reply = client.recv(1024).decode()
print("Server says:", reply)

# close connection
client.close()



Result:
  Thus, The socket programming in tcp using python excuted successfully.
